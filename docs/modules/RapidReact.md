## Functions

### allianceRapidReactRP

â–¸ **allianceRapidReactRP**(`teams`): `number`

Since Rapid React's ranking points are based on the alliance's performance,
rather than any individual robot, this function calculates an *alliance's* ranking points.

`teams` should be an array of matches: one for each robot on the alliance in the given match

#### Parameters

| :------ | :------ |
| `teams` | [`RapidReactMatch`](../classes/RapidReact.RapidReactMatch.md)[] |
